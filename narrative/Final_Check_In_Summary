My objective is to create a job market friendly tool centered around skill acquisition. It retrieves skill sets
offered by individual courses for students to both have the ability to review courses taken and more readily guide their course choices
toward a toolkit-focused model of preparedness to accommodate their needs for adaptability in a marketplace where graduates
in class selection when preparing for jobs whose potential job descriptions may not even been written yet. Skill set building and modularity are crucial features
of any program preparing students for the realities of the working world now and in the years to come. This program would easily and enjoyably
allow the user to discover which courses offer the skills they are most interested in acquiring for their personal path to success.
On a larger level, I'm interested in developing a way for students, professors, advisers, recruiters and hiring managers to communicate
through the language of course-based skill sets. Ideally, a course could be plugged in and one could discover which skills are associated with it.
Did/should the student/candidate take the course? The program can help the user discover more about the content of the course to
help the user make a decision or take the next step in the journey.

I am planning to build a proof of concept to test out the functionality on a small scale. I draw from a sample pool of 15 courses
I've selected from the iSchool courses website to discover the top skills based on key words entered
I start with skill based key words found in the pool. I build a word frequency dictionary of target words which represent skills and develop a
target word (skill) list based on review of the course descriptions which the code can retrieve (word and count).
(This would be an area for later development in reality.)

Next, I will test out text summarization techniques of course descriptions to understand
the skill sets described in course descriptions.
