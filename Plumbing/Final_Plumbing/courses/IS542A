Course_Description:


An introduction to statistical and probabilistic models as they pertain to quantifying
information, assessing information quality, and principled application of information to
decision­making. The increasing prevalence of massive data sets and falling
computational barriers have rendered statistical modeling an integral part of
contemporary information management. With this in mind, this class prepares students
to select and properly undertake commonly encountered modeling tasks. The course
reviews relevant results from probability theory, emphasizing the merits and limitations
of familiar probability distributions as vehicles for modeling information. Subsequent
consideration includes parametric and non­parametric predictive models, as well as a
discussion of extensions of these models for unsupervised learning. Throughout these
discussions, the course focuses on model selection and gauging model quality.
Applications of statistical and probabilistic models to tasks in information management
(e.g. prediction, ranking, and data reduction) are emphasized.


Learning_Objectives:


Students will demonstrate an understanding of probability theory and statistical learning
by building and evaluating models of a diverse range of data sets. By the end of the
course students will have basic concepts of what constitutes a “good” statistical
question, what one can feasibly learn and predict with data, and an overview of toolsets
and methods to answer elementary statistical questions.  In particular, each student will
be able to:
● Articulate the role of marginal, joint, and conditional probability in modeling
processes involving information.
● Select, parameterize, and compare probability distributions as vehicles for
modeling information.
● Specify, estimate and evaluate elementary parametric statistical models.
● Specify, estimate and evaluate elementary non­parametric statistical models.
● Articulate professional responsibilities with respect to creating, describing and
using models built from data.

Pre_Reqs:

Pre­ and Co­requisite

IS452 Foundations of Information Processing is strongly recommended as a
prerequisite. A highly motivated student could pass this course without IS452 (so the
prerequisite is not enforced), but programming will not be covered in this course.
Students who have not completed an introductory course on statistics will need to come
up to speed quickly on material covered early in the semester.
