Course_Description

COURSE OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this course is to walk the analytics
neophyte through every stage of an analytics project from
initial data collection, to visualization, to predictive modeling
while discussing the tools, methods, and stakeholders
involved along the way. This course is designed as an
introduction to position students for more in-depth iSchool
courses in later semesters.
Using MySQL, students will be introduced to the
fundamentals of relational database design and data
warehousing architecture; learning to use SQL to transform
and manipulate data. Visualization and data summarization
will be discussed as students are introduced to Tableau to
create dynamic narratives that highlight key performance
indicators (KPI’s). Finally, using R, students will learn the
foundational principles of statistics culminating in the
exploration of different predictive modeling techniques.
Because successfully interfacing with stakeholders is vital to
any analytics project, students will also explore approaches
to project management along with several different
techniques for cultivating institutional investment in
analytics programs.
KEYS TO SUCCESS
Due to the introductory nature of the course and its
online format, students will be required to invest a certain
amount of time outside of the classroom each week to
master course content. The successful student will be
independently curious – meaning that they will take the
tools and methods presented in lectures as a starting point
and will expand on them on their own during the week and
while completing course assignments.
