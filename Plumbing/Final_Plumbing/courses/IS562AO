Course_Description:

Course Description & Objectives:
Metadata plays an increasingly critical role in the creation, distribution, management and use of electronic materials.
This course will combine theoretical examination of the design of metadata schema with their practical application in
a variety of settings. Hands-on experience in the creation of descriptive, administrative and structural metadata,
along with their application in systems such as OAI harvesting, OpenURL resolution systems, and digital repositories,
will help students develop a thorough understanding of current metadata standards as well as such issues as crosswalking
metadata schema, metadata's use in information retrieval and data management applications, and the role of standards
bodies in metadata schema development.
