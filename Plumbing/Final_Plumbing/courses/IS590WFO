Course_Description


A course in the use and evaluation of Web application frameworks for system architects,
designers, and developers.

Detailed Course Description


Today, many substantial Web applications are designed and built using a Web
application framework. These frameworks provide standard ways to build and deploy
Web applications that can increase developer productivity, increase software quality,
and reduce application maintenance. Web frameworks typically use architectural
patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) to separate code that implements the data
model, business rules, and user interface. Frequently, they also employ architectural
patterns like a database persistence layer to greatly simplify database coding within the
Web application. Other common features of Web application frameworks include built-in
support for Web page templating, user authentication/authorization, content caching,
URL mapping, session management, Web services, and various content management
features.

This course will explore the common features of Web application frameworks in general
while providing hands-on experience using Django, a popular open-source Web
application framework based on Python. Students will complete a series of coding
assignments that build Django design/development/deployment skills while providing
insights into standard features of Web application frameworks. In the final project, each
student will design and build a full-featured Django Web application to address a
problem of her/his own choosing.
The audience for this course includes system architects, designers, and developers who
wish to consider a Web application framework as a platform for creating substantial Web
applications. These include business applications, digital libraries, institutional
repositories, and research data repositories, as well as workflow applications for data
collection, data extraction, data cleaning, and data analysis.
Prerequisites
• Experience in creating static Web sites using HTML and CSS
• Experience in Python programming (IS452 or equivalent)
• Experience in creating dynamic Web sites using tools like PHP is helpful but not
required.
• Experience in using relational databases is helpful but not required.

Technology Requirements
You will be completing coding assignments and conducting your final project using your
own computer. I recommend that you use a computer that runs Windows 10 or a recent
release of MacOS. While the software that we will be using for this course does run on
Linux computers, there will be substantially less technical support available for Linux. If
you want to use a Linux computer for your coursework, please contact me first.
You will be installing the following software on your computers for this class:
• The PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE) for Python
• The Anaconda open data science platform for Python
• The Git version control system
• The SourceTree client for Git
You will be deploying some of your coding assignment solutions to a cloud-based
Django hosting facility provided by Python Anywhere. Free accounts are available from
Python Anywhere that have all of the capabilities that you will need during the course.
All of the software and services that you will be using are free for your use during this
class. I have recorded detailed tutorial videos to help you download, install, and begin
using the required software on computers running Windows 10 and recent releases of
MacOS. Links to these resources will be provided in our Weekly Schedule.
Course Schedule
The schedule for this course will be available via our Weekly Schedule at:
https://courseinfo.ligent.net/2018fa/_illinois/is590wfo/index.html
The course schedule is always subject to reasonable change to account for changes in
circumstance and to correct errors. When I make changes to the schedule, I will
announce them via the Moodle Announcements Forum.


Course_Elements


1. Readings
Required readings will be assigned from the resources listed above and from other
resources that will be identified in the Weekly Schedule. Generally, readings are
chosen to accompany our online lecture/discussion session for the week. So, you
should expect to complete the readings before class.
Optional readings will be assigned from time to time. These will typically represent
alternate expressions of the same material, or interesting supplementary topics.
IS590WFO – Web Development Using Application Frameworks Page 4 of 7
2. Tutorial Videos
I will be providing a series of tutorial videos that show a skill being practiced using
the PyCharm IDE and related software tools. Typically, you will be assigned a
parallel coding assignment in the same week that can be accomplished using the
approach demonstrated in the video.
3. Coding Assignments
There will be Coding Assignments approximately weekly. As mentioned above,
coding assignments will often be paired with tutorial videos. These should allow you
to complete your Coding Assignment using the same approach that has been
demonstrated in the video.
A Moodle dropbox will be provided for submitting each assignment. Instructions for
each Coding Assignment and a grading rubric will be published in the Weekly
Schedule.
Solutions to the Coding Assignments will be reviewed at the start of our next class. I
will ask for one or two student volunteers to present their work and we will discuss it
(constructively and supportively). Then, I will present my version of the assignment
solution (never perfect) and we will discuss that as well. The real learning comes
from the combination of having attempted to solve the coding assignment and the
subsequent discussion. Those who have really done the work before the class
discussion of the assignment will get that benefit. Those who wait and do the work
later will get a greatly reduced benefit. Having seen our solutions, they will miss out
on the benefit of having tackled one of these problems on their own.
A major goal for this course is to build your proficiency in self-evaluation of your work.
To build this skill, I will expect you to be able to estimate your grade on each Coding
Assignment. After each Coding Assignment, we will review solutions during our next
class. Further, I will publish a copy of my solution on our Moodle page. These
published solutions and solution discussions will serve as your primary feedback for
the Coding Assignment.
As secondary feedback, your Coding Assignment submissions will be graded and
commented upon. This feedback will be published to the Moodle assignment
submission activity within approximately 2 weeks.
While separate grading rubric and assignment submission instructions documents
will be published, the following is a summary of the grading rubric features for coding
assignments:
• 10 points will be awarded for submitting a single, properly named, properly
organized, and gradable file to the proper Moodle assignment submission
activity.
• A minimum of 75 points will be awarded for submissions that are submitted
on time, and that demonstrate a good faith effort on all parts of the
assignment. Late submissions will be awarded 74 points or fewer in this
category.
IS590WFO – Web Development Using Application Frameworks Page 5 of 7
The implication of this grading scheme is that you can expect a score of 85 or higher
on all Coding Assignments that meet both of these criteria.
4. Participation
a. You are expected to read all of the posts made in all of the discussion forums
and respond with short posts when appropriate.
b. On Tuesday evenings from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM, we will have an optional
Online Lab Session using the Blackboard Collaborate Ultra platform. For more
details, see Online Lab Sessions above.
Participation grades will be based upon the number of participation points earned
during the semester. These are the activities through which you can earn
participation points:
5. Framework Evaluation Paper
Each student will write a paper presenting the conclusions of their evaluation of the
suitability of a candidate Web application framework (other than Django) for a set of
functional and non-functional requirements which they could reasonably expect to
encounter in the workplace. Your paper should be about 1500 to 2000 words. In
addition, you will need to cite a minimum of 10 sources.
Detailed instructions and a grading rubric for the Framework Evaluation Paper will
be published separately.
6. Final Project
You will be expected to plan, gather requirements for, design, code, test, and
deploy a Web application using Django as your Final Project. Detailed instructions
and grading rubric for the Final Project will be published separately. The following
are highlights from those requirements:
• The Web application should fully demonstrate the Web application
framework features covered in the class.
• The Web application should include significant add/change/delete database
functionality.
• The Web application should be sufficiently interesting to you that you are
likely to continue to develop and maintain after the course is complete.
