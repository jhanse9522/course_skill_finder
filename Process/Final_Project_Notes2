So far:

-searched through Spring 2019 and culled 17 course description samples from the syllabi of I School classes from
Spring 2019 with intent to choose 15.

-read in a rough "course description file" as one corpus

-created a word frequency dictionary counter

-checked membership of target word from target word list in file

Next steps:

- I need to revise/clean up the text to include just the course descriptions

- Read the clean file in

- Write out each course description to a separate outfiles (15 of these)

- Figure out the desired format for data output

- Create the design of how the data will be stored in each of the 5 technique outputs

- So, for each of 15 course descriptions -> 5 different outputs (1 for each
technique), each output designed in same fashion



- Do stuff to infile

    Test out Text Summarizing Algorithms


- Write each result of each algorithm to a separate outfile


- Compare results of each technique looking at each outfile side by side


- Use .py file and iterate as needed (make modifications manually adding code bits and bobs if needed to get to supreme output)


- Yield "Beautiful File" with the Final Working Program Results!


- Write functions to distill down to desired single output (the end made product)
