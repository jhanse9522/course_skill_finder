This repo is a work in progress. The intent is to ultimately create a job market friendly tool centered around skill acquision retrieving skill sets offered by individual courses for students to have the ability to review courses taken and guide course choices toward a toolkit-focused model of preparedness. It's currently in the exploratory phase. Data from a sampling of syllabi (15) from University of Illinois iSchoolSpring Semester 2019 is used as a prototype to test. A general design pattern can be seen in the data_extraction directory. Data culls are found in data_gathering directory. The work-in-progress data processing code files are found in py_files (Py_Charm) and Jup_IS_452 (Jupyter Notebooks). The work-in-progress plumbing code can be found in Plumbing. A table-of-contents navigation can be found in manifest_file.
